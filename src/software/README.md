# Packet Generator
----

### Makefile
List all your dependencies on the Makefile and add proper directives for 
generating the executables.

### Compile
All Targets have their own executables. The name of the executable is same as 
directive
For Packet Generator:
        make packet_gen  generates executable packet_gen.




To illustrate what we aim to solve,consider the following scenario.
| Output1       | Output 2      | Output 3        |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| 2             | 1             |   1   |
| 1             | 0             |   2   |
| 2             | 2             |    0  |

##Links 
[This](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/research/projects/newudpl/) is the link 
for the proxy emulator which can change the packet contents. We will be using 
this as a reference for the project.

## Files

Software related code needs to be here. This will include the packet generator 
and the validator, mostly!
